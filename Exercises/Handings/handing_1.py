# NOTE : Opgavebeskrivelse
# Exercise 2.8 - handin 1 (down payment)
# Write a program to compute how many months it takes to pay down a loan, that has a fixed monthly interest rate, and the borrower makes a fixed monthly payment. The program should ask the user for three values: The size of the initial loan, the monthly interest rate in percent, and the size of the monthly payment of the borrower. The program should output for each month the size of the remaining loan.
# Handin format. The handin should consist of a single Python file, e.g. handin1.py. The files should start with a Python docstring (string in triple quotes, """ or ''') containing the study ids and names of the students who made the handin. A handin group consists of 1-3 students. Furthermore the docstring must contain a short reflection (5-10 lines) on your solution to the exercise. This could be a short discussion of the design choices you made during your implementation, the problems you encountered, what were the hard and easy parts to get your solution to work, what restrictions on the user input did you make, limitations in your implementation, what language features were particularly useful, ... A template for the handin is below. The filename of a submission must contain the names of all group members and their study id.
